# Snake-Game-Project
A classic arcade-style Snake game built in Java using AWT and Swing for the GUI framework. The player controls a snake that moves around the window, eats food to grow longer, and must avoid colliding with walls or its own body. The game includes score tracking, increasing difficulty, and simple keyboard controls.
